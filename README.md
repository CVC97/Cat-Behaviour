# Simulating the Behaviour of a Cat in the Presence of a Human Being

Based on the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05400 from Anxo Biasi, this web-based simulation models the movement of a cat around a human being.


## Physical Description of a Cats Behaviour

The behaviour of a cat is going to be modeled based on the following observations:

- **P1:** Cats prefer a certain distance to humans.
- **P2:** When resting on a person, minimal stimuli can make the cat leave that position depending on the bond-strength of human and cat.
- **P3:** 

### P1:
